# [Day 1](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1) in COBOL

IN THE SPIRIT OF COBOL, THIS README IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE CAPS LOCK KEY.
WELL, NOT REALLY, BECAUSE I'M USING VIM AND CAPS LOCK WOULD MESS UP ALL
COMMANDS, SO I'M JUST HOLDING SHIFT INSTEAD.

SO, DAY ONE, IN THE COBOL LANGUAGE. THIS IS SO OLD THAT IT WAS PRETTY MUCH DEAD
BEFORE I WAS BORN. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING SO I INSTALLED GNUCOBOL. I
FEEL LIKE A MASOCHIST ALREADY. TIMES WILL BE INTERESTING.

Huh, okay. Actually GnuCOBOL is not case sensitive. Pleasant.
