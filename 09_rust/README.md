# [Day 9](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/9) in Rust

I never used Rust before, but I know it's supposed to be "a better C", with a
strong emphasis on safety. This sort of language seems suitable for fairly
straightforward input-to-output conversion needed in this puzzle.

First impressions of the Rust language are really good! It looks well designed, nice and explicit in everything. None of the "magic" that is supposed to make things easy but often just ends up confusing me. Compiler warnings are super helpful too (e.g. `denote infinite loops with loop` when naive me used `while true`).
