# [Day 23](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/23) in C99

"You should be able to use the same assembunny interpreter for this as you did
there"â€¦ ha ha ha, not for the silly Polyglot Challenge programmer. Okay,
rewrite from scratch in C instead of OCaml.

Part One was a quite straightforward implementation of the language. As usual,
parsing was the main hurdle. Once I got the right output on the example, I ran
it on the real input and found the right answer there too.

Then Part Two... changing the initial value of `a` to `12` was easy. But yes,
it took a while to run... "don't bunnies usually multiply?" What could that
mean? Should `inc` be interpreted as `mul`? But it has only one argument, so
multiply what with what?

My next thought was that the input program was actually computing a
multiplication using an inordinate number of `inc` instructions, and we're
supposed to figure out where it does that, and how to make it faster. But I
decided to try some more brute force first, and added `-O3` to the compiler
flags. It came up with the correct answer (around half a billion) in 17
seconds. Thank you, C!
