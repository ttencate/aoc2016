# [Day 21](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/21) in Perl

Today is mostly a parsing and string manipulation job, no fancy algorithms or
data structures necessary. So what better language to solve this in than the
king of the regexp, the Practical Extraction and Report Language? Only, I
haven't Perled in maybe ten years or so, and even then I wasn't very
experienced.
