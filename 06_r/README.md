This directory contains the solutions for [day
6](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/6) in the R statistical computing language.

I had never worked with R before, so this was a bit of a challenge. The main
problem was to understand R's data types (array, vector, list, matrix, and
something called a "factor") and how to use them. The end result is a oneliner
(albeit a long one), in which swapping out `which.max` for `which.min` gave the
solution to the secord part of the puzzle.
