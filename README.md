# Polyglot Advent of Code 2016

[Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016) is a programming contest,
in which a new puzzle comes online every day from 1 until 25 December. These
are my solutions to the puzzles. As an additional challenge, I'm solving each
day's puzzle in a different programming language.

## Languages

I'm using only "mainstream" programming languages, not esoteric or toy
languages, because this will be hard enough as is. However, I do include some
older languages in the list out of historic interest. Plus, a free (as in beer)
implementation for Linux has to exist.

Languages I might still use, roughly in order of decreasing preference (based
both on what I know, and what might be suitable for such puzzles):

* JavaScript
* C#
* C++
* Java
* Go
* Haskell
* C
* Haxe
* Ruby
* Groovy
* Lua
* Perl
* PHP
* BASIC
* Clojure
* Elixir
* REBOL
* Forth
* F#
* Kotlin
* Octave
* Erlang
* Icon
* CUDA
* TCL
* Smalltalk
* Julia
* AWK
* J
* APL
* Ada

Used:

* COBOL
* D
* Fortran 90
* OCaml
* Pascal
* Python
* R
* Rust
* Scala
* Scheme
* Sh (bash and common shell utilities)
* x86 assembly

## Rules

* Input should be read from stdin if at all possible. Otherwise, read from a
  file named `input`.
* The input file must be read and parsed exactly as provided. No modifications
  are allowed.
