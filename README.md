# Polyglot Advent of Code 2016

[Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016) is a programming contest,
in which a new puzzle comes online every day from 1 until 25 December. These
are my solutions to the puzzles. As an additional challenge, I solved each
day's puzzle in a different programming language.

## Languages

I used only "mainstream" programming languages, not esoteric or toy languages,
because this will be hard enough as is. However, I did include some older
languages in the list out of historic interest. Plus, a free (as in beer)
implementation for Linux has to exist.

Languages I could still have used, roughly in order of decreasing preference
(based both on what I know, and what might be suitable for such puzzles):

* Java
* PHP
* BASIC
* Clojure
* Elixir
* CoffeeScript
* Dart
* Nim
* REBOL
* Forth
* F#
* Kotlin
* Octave
* Erlang
* Icon
* Eiffel
* Prolog
* CUDA
* GLSL
* TCL
* Smalltalk
* Julia
* AWK
* J
* APL
* Ada
* Algol
* 6502 assembly

Used:

* C ([day 23](23_c))
* C++ ([day 24](24_cpp))
* C# ([day 17](17_cs))
* COBOL ([day 1](01_cobol))
* D ([day 11](11_d))
* Fortran 90 ([day 8](08_fortran))
* Go ([day 25](25_go))
* Groovy ([day 13](13_groovy))
* Haskell ([day 16](16_haskell))
* Haxe ([day 22](22_haxe))
* JavaScript ([day 20](20_javascript))
* Lua ([day 18](18_lua))
* OCaml ([day 12](12_ocaml))
* OpenCL ([day 14](14_opencl))
* Pascal ([day 10](10_pascal))
* Pen and paper (and a calculator) ([day 15](15_pen_and_paper))
* Perl ([day 21](21_perl))
* Python ([day 5](05_python))
* R ([day 6](06_r))
* Ruby ([day 19](19_ruby))
* Rust ([day 9](09_rust))
* Scala ([day 3](03_scala))
* Scheme ([day 2](02_scheme))
* Sh (bash and common shell utilities) ([day 4](04_bash))
* x86 assembly ([day 7](07_x86_assembly))

## Rules

* Input should be read from stdin if at all possible. Otherwise, read from a
  file named `input`.
* The input file must be read and parsed exactly as provided. No modifications
  are allowed.
