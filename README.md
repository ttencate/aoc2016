# Polyglot Advent of Code 2016

[Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016) is a programming contest,
in which a new puzzle comes online every day from 1 until 25 December. These
are my solutions to the puzzles. As an additional challenge, I solved each
day's puzzle in a different programming language.

## Languages

I used only "mainstream" programming languages, not esoteric or toy languages,
because this will be hard enough as is. However, I did include some older
languages in the list out of historic interest. Plus, a free (as in beer)
implementation for Linux has to exist.

Languages I could still have used, roughly in order of decreasing preference
(based both on what I know, and what might be suitable for such puzzles):

* Java
* PHP
* BASIC
* Clojure
* Elixir
* CoffeeScript
* Dart
* Nim
* REBOL
* Forth
* F#
* Kotlin
* Octave
* Erlang
* Icon
* Eiffel
* Prolog
* CUDA
* GLSL
* TCL
* Smalltalk
* Julia
* AWK
* J
* APL
* Ada
* Algol
* 6502 assembly

Used:

* C
* C++
* C#
* COBOL
* D
* Fortran 90
* Go
* Groovy
* Haskell
* Haxe
* JavaScript
* Lua
* OCaml
* OpenCL
* Pascal
* Pen and paper (and a calculator)
* Perl
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Scheme
* Sh (bash and common shell utilities)
* x86 assembly

## Rules

* Input should be read from stdin if at all possible. Otherwise, read from a
  file named `input`.
* The input file must be read and parsed exactly as provided. No modifications
  are allowed.
