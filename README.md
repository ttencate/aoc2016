# Advent of Code 2016

These are my solutions to [Advent of
Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016) puzzles.

At some point I thought it would be fun to do each in a different
language, but I'm not sure I'll have the time to learn a few new
ones. I have a few solutions in Python already, so I'd have to
port those.

Languages I'm comfortable with:

* Assembly (6502 or Z80; x86 if I'm feeling adventurous)
* BASIC
* C
* C#
* C++
* Go
* Haskell
* Haxe
* Java
* JavaScript
* PHP
* Perl
* <s>Python</s>
* Ruby
* <s>Sh (bash and common shell utilities)</s>

Languages I've never or almost never used before:

* APL
* Ada
* Clojure
* Cobol
* Common Lisp
* D
* Elixir
* Erlang
* F#
* Fortran
* Groovy
* J
* Kotlin
* Lua
* OCaml
* Octave
* R
* Rust
